# [name] v.0.1 - Decentralized loginId  (first steps to web3)


**[name]** is an easy and fast new way to connect to the internet without the need of creating or logging each time you visit your favourite websites. **[name]** will be your main Internet Id, like your main password. The only time to create the account will be during the setup of **[name]**. After, no need to create accounts and remember passwords for each websites you are visiting. **[name]** works in conjunction with Ethereum blockchain. Each time a new InternetId is created, a new smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The main goal of the project was to create a decentralized, secured and anonymous login in which You own Your data and not the websites. 

## Main points:
- Decentralized. One Id and pass for infinite websites
- Secure. Id is securely and immutably crypted on the Ethereum blockchain
- hackers who manage to steal the website's information will have no information of your data (login, passwords, etc.)
- Ownership. You only have access to the your data.
- Anonymous. IDs are anonymously stored on the blockchain as randomly generated numbers and letters.
- No password manager needed anymore. Passwords are stored nowhere. Not on **[name]**, not either the blochchain. It uses the
- Easy to install and configure
- Developers who wish to employ a decentralized login on their new or existing websites will have a simple framework ([name].js)

## Similar projects and why [name] is better
- uPort
- ERC725

## To discuss:
- Target the French market first?
- Dapp as Plugin Firefox or webservice(but risk of phishing)

## To work on:
- Disconnecting cases
- Thief cases.

## Things to improve:
- **[name]** currently uses the Ethereum blockchain. Deploying and executing smart contracts needs gas, therefore ether. A way to eliminate the fees would be to use another blockchain
